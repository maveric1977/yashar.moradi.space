As a seasoned lean/agile coach with over 25 years of experience, I am passionate about helping businesses achieve their technology and leadership goals through data-driven solutions. Lean/agile methodologies are key to achieving this, and I offer coaching services to help businesses adopt and implement these methodologies in their product development processes.

> "Agile isn't a process, it's a mindset. It's about adapting to change, continuously improving, and delivering value to customers faster." - Linda Rising

My approach to lean/agile coaching is based on a deep understanding of the latest industry trends and best practices, as well as a wealth of practical experience. I work closely with businesses to assess their current processes, identify areas for improvement, and create a customized lean/agile implementation plan that is tailored to their specific needs.

My coaching services cover all aspects of lean/agile implementation, including:

* Agile development methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Lean
* Continuous integration and delivery practices
* Test-driven development and behavior-driven development
* Lean startup principles and product development techniques
* Project management and team collaboration tools

I provide hands-on coaching to ensure that businesses are able to successfully implement these methodologies and realize the full benefits of lean/agile development. My coaching is designed to empower teams to be more efficient, productive, and collaborative, resulting in faster time-to-market, better product quality, and improved customer satisfaction.

If you are looking to adopt lean/agile methodologies in your business, or if you are struggling to implement them effectively, I am here to help. Contact me to learn more about my lean/agile coaching services and how I can help you achieve your technology and leadership goals.
