## The Moment Everything Almost Crashed

A few years ago, I was **running on fumes.** On paper, I had it all—2 kids, a wife, a fast-growing startup, and a rock band. From the outside, it looked like I was thriving. But inside? **I was barely holding it together.**

I convinced myself I could do it all if I just worked harder. Late nights, jam-packed schedules, sneaking in family time between work calls. *“Just push through—things will calm down soon,”* I told myself.

But they never did.

Then, **I crashed—twice.**

The first time, I recognized the signs early. I pulled back, made adjustments, and thought I had it under control. For a while, things felt manageable. But as soon as life felt easier, I slipped right back into the old patterns—overcommitting, stretching myself too thin, putting everything before my own well-being.

Then, **it happened again.** This time, I knew I couldn’t afford another false fix. I needed a system that worked—not just for a few weeks, but for life.

## The Trap of Productivity Hacks

Like most high-achievers, I thought the answer was **better time management.**

*If I could just optimize my schedule…*\
*If I could squeeze in a little more…*\
*If I could just be more disciplined…*

But the truth hit me hard: **It wasn’t about time. It was about how I was approaching everything.**

I kept adding more strategies, more tools, more ‘hacks,’ but none of them actually changed the way I operated. I was rearranging the pieces without changing the game.

## The Shift That Changed Everything

I finally stopped looking for *more* and started stripping things away.

I had spent years building businesses—solving problems, prioritizing what mattered, and cutting the fluff. But I had never applied those same principles to my own life.

So, I started running my life **like I would a business.**

Here’s what I did:

### **1️⃣ Working in Cycles, Not Chaos**

I stopped letting my days be dictated by endless lists and instead broke my time into structured, focused cycles. I set clear targets, tackled what mattered most, and ignored the noise.

### **2️⃣ Cutting the Dead Weight**

Instead of piling on more, I asked myself:

- **Does this really need to be done?**
- **Is there a simpler way?**
- **What would happen if I let this go?**

Turns out, **a lot of things don’t actually need your energy.**

### **3️⃣ Making Reflection a Habit**

I used to power through without stopping to see if what I was doing was even working. Now, I check in regularly:

- What’s actually moving the needle? 🔥
- What’s just noise? ❌
- What needs to change? 🔄

It sounds simple, but these small shifts changed everything.

## The Results? More Control, Less Stress, and a Life That Finally Feels Like Mine

Since making these changes, I’ve:

✅ Stopped feeling like I was constantly behind.\
✅ Focused on what actually matters—in work and life.\
✅ Had **more time for family, hobbies, and real rest.**

And here’s the crazy part: **Now, even with 3 kids, an early stage startup, a volunteer role at opensource.construction, and a freelance coaching and advisory, I feel more balanced than ever.**

Because now, instead of trying to do everything, I know exactly what’s worth doing.

## If You’re Stuck in the Same Cycle…
