## The Moment Everything Almost Crashed

A few years ago, I was **running on fumes.** I had it all—2 kids, a wife, a fast-growing startup, and a rock band. From the outside, it looked like I was crushing it. But inside? **I was barely holding it together.**

I worked late nights, squeezed in family time when I could, and told myself, *“Just push through—things will calm down soon.”* But they never did.

Then, **I almost burned out—twice.**

The first time, I recognized the problem and found a solution that worked—for a while. I felt in control again, but as things improved, I slowly drifted back to old habits. But then, as things got better, I slowly drifted back to **business as usual.** I started overcommitting again, taking on more work, and falling into the same patterns. And then, **it happened again.**

The second time, I knew I wouldn’t be so lucky.

I had a choice: **Keep running myself into the ground or build a system that actually worked long-term.**

## The Productivity Myth That’s Keeping You Stuck

Like most high-performers, I thought my problem was time. *If only I could optimize my schedule more…* *If I could work just a little harder…* *If I could find the perfect productivity hack…*

All lies.

- A new app won’t fix how you prioritize.
- Another time-blocking method won’t stop you from overcommitting.
- More hours at the desk won’t magically create better results.

I finally realized: **The problem wasn’t time—it was execution.**

## Running Life Like a High-Performance Startup

I knew what worked in business. Agile. Lean execution. Iteration. Prioritization. Why wasn’t I applying that to my life?

So I started treating **my own time, energy, and focus like a startup.**

Here’s what changed everything:

### **1️⃣ Sprints Over To-Do Lists**
Instead of drowning in endless tasks, I started working in **1- or 2-week sprints.** No more decision fatigue—just clear, focused execution.

### **2️⃣ Eliminate, Automate, Delegate**
I looked at everything I was doing and asked:
- **Does this task even need to happen? (Eliminate)**
- **Can software or AI handle this? (Automate)**
- **Who else can take this off my plate? (Delegate)**

### **3️⃣ Weekly Retrospectives**
Every week, I took 10 minutes to reflect:
- What worked? 🔥
- What didn’t? ❌
- What will I change next week? 🔄

This constant iteration is what makes Agile so powerful.

## The Results? More Focus, Less Stress, and Real Progress

Since applying Agile to my life, I’ve:
✅ Stopped feeling overwhelmed by endless work.  
✅ Created more **focused execution** in my business.  
✅ Had **more time for family, hobbies, and actual rest.**

And the best part? **Even though I now have 3 kids, a volunteer role at opensource.construction, and a freelance coaching and advisory, I feel more balanced than ever.**

This isn’t theory. It’s a **battle-tested system** that works.
