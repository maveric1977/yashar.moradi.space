My approach is rooted in strategic thinking and a deep understanding of today's technology landscape. By combining my technical know-how with my experience in coaching and mentoring teams, I'm able to help businesses of all sizes unlock their full potential and thrive in the digital world.

In addition to my work as a fractional CTO and lean/agile coach, I'm an avid learner and always seeking new challenges. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends, and I'm committed to sharing my knowledge and insights with others through speaking engagements, mentorship opportunities, and more.
